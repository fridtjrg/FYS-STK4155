# Folder structure

## Deadline extensions

## `*project` - Source code
All the source code in Python of the projects are contains in the folders `1project`, `2project`, `3project`.

### Libraries
All the functions are contained in separate files to be imported.

For project 1, it has been create a specific package: the **"regan" (Regression Analysis) package**.
The functions developed for this project are put in the regan folder, with a __ _init_ __.py file to export the functions used externally.

### Scripts for each task
The files `task*.py` are used to do what is asked for in each task. Run them to generate the relevant plots. 


## `reports` - Project reports
All files necessary for the reports are be found here.

### `Project*_delivery.ipynb`
Project*_delivery.ipynb are the reports in Jupyter Notebook.

### `img`
Images used to explain concepts in the reports are stored here.

### `Proj*_Plots`
The Plots folders contain the resulting plots as figures (also runnable from the Jupyter Notebook).

### `Proj*_Datafiles`
The DataFiles folders contain the datafiles used as input in the task (e.g. terrain data for task6).
