# Project 1


## The "regan" (Regression Analysis) package
The functions developed for this project are put in the regan folder, with a __ _init_ __.py file to export the functions used externally.

## Proj1_Datafiles
The DataFiles folder contains the datfiles used in task6.

## Proj1_Plots
The Plots contains some example figures generated by the run_plot_compare function in the regan package.

## Scripts for each task
The files task1.py - task6.py are used to do what is asked for in each task. Run them to generate the relevant plots.
