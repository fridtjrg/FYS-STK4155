while GD contains all other plots(e.g. regression with OLS or SGD).

###NeuralNetworks/
This folder contains the source code for the Neural Netorks(NeuralNetwokClassification.py and NeuralNetworkRegression.py). It also contains the source code we used to obtain different plots and predictions. 

###SGD/
This folder contains out stochastic gradient decent source code. It also contains the code we used to obtain different plots, such as the regresson without SGD.

###Arkive/
