    "##### Authors: Adele Zaini, Gaute Arnesson Holen, Fridtjof Gjengset\n",
    "##### Date: 11. October, 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before we start: \n",
    "\n",
    "### General introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first project we are asked to explore the techniques of Regression, as the basic step to go further deeply into Machine Learning, and the resampling methods, such as Bootstrap and Cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We started working with a vanilla dataset given by the Franke function, depending of two indenpendent variables $x$ and $y$, in order to set up all our regression and resampling methods. At the end, we performed the code with a real dataset taken from a terrain survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Franke function is a weighted sum of four exponentials:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "f(x,y) &= \\frac{3}{4}\\exp{\\left(-\\frac{(9x-2)^2}{4} - \\frac{(9y-2)^2}{4}\\right)}+\\frac{3}{4}\\exp{\\left(-\\frac{(9x+1)^2}{49}- \\frac{(9y+1)}{10}\\right)} \\\\\n",
    "&+\\frac{1}{2}\\exp{\\left(-\\frac{(9x-7)^2}{4} - \\frac{(9y-3)^2}{4}\\right)} -\\frac{1}{5}\\exp{\\left(-(9x-4)^2 - (9y-7)^2\\right) }.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The function is defined for $x,y\\in [0,1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Regression methods that has been implemented are the Linear (Ordinary Least Square), Ridge and Lasso Regression. For further details, see the introduction of the respective exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the quality of the model, we perfom an error analysis, usually involving the Mean Square Error ($MSE$) and the $R^2$ score function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "MSE(\\hat{y},\\hat{\\tilde{y}}) = \\frac{1}{n}\n",
    "\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i-\\tilde{y}_i)^2,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R^2(\\hat{y}, \\tilde{\\hat{y}}) = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1} (y_i - \\tilde{y}_i)^2}{\\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tilde{\\hat{y}}_i$ is the predicted value of the $i-th$ sample, $y_i$ is the corresponding true value and $\\hat{y}$ is the mean value given by $ \\bar{y} =  \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1} y_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $MSE$ is explored as function of complexity, in particular when dividing the dataset into training and test data, in order to find the optimal \"complexity\" (i.e. degree of polynomial). To get a better extimation of the $MSE$ it has been coupled with resampling methods, and to have a better understanding and deeper comprehension, a bias-variance tradeoff analysis has been performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is structured into libraries (e.g. `regression.py`), which gather all the functions needed for solving the various tasks, while the specific task codes are in `task*.py` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the course of this notebook, we inserted runnable cells to run the task codes directly and dynamically from here to show up the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a brief introduction, we will explain the algorithm, show the results and comment on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: a further improvement to the code would be structuring as object-oriented. We have started converting the code in a new branch.*\n",

    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "After setting up our vanilla dataset using the FrankeFunction with two indipendent variables, we perfom a Ordinary Least Square regression.\n",
    "We structured the code with all the useful functions in a library called 'linear_regression.py', while specific analysises due for the exercise are in 'task1.py'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implemented functions are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **create_X**(x,y,n) : Creates the designmatrix with a complexity n.\n",
    "- **Frankefunction**(x,y) : Calculates the frankefunction fro the values x and y.\n",
    "- **Plot_frankefunction**(z,y,z) : Creates a 3d plot\n",
    "- **Split_and_Scale**(X,z,test_size, scale) : Splits the dataset using **train_test_split** from scikit learn, into a test_size which has default value set to *0.2*. Scales the data using **StandardScalar()** if boolean argument *scale=True*(it's default value). \n",
    "- **OLS_solver**(X_train, X_test, z_train, z_test) : Which calculates the optimal $\\hat{\\beta}$ values through matix inversion and returns these values, as well as our model $\\tilde{z}$ and out prediction. \n",
    "- **MSE**(y_data, y_model) : calculates the mean square error of a dataset compared to a model or prediction.\n",
    "- **R2**(y_data,y_model) : calculates the R2 score of a dataset compared to a model or prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "After splitting the data using **Split_and_Scale()**, we find the OLS using **OLS_solver()** on the Frankefunction by matrix inversion. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by simply importing the functions and creating the dataset, as well as adding some noise to the dataset:\n"

We import the function **plot_ols_complexity**(x, y, z, complexity) from the linear_regression library, which does exactly this. It's default valye for complexity is set to **range(2,20)**.

Around a polynomial of the 5th degree, we can see that the MSE for the test data increases, while the MSE for the train data continues to decrease. This is beacuse the increased complexity of the designmatrix causes overfitting. Out model therefore fits the training data better, but gives a poor model for the test data, because it has overfitted to the training set. It seems out model does best around a complexity of n=5.\n"
