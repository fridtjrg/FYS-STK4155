    "## Before we start: \n",
    "\n",
    "After a general introduction and some theoretical background with elements shared and useful for each exercise, we move more deeply into the explanation and presentation of each task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first project we were asked to explore the techniques of Regression, as the basic step to go further deeply into Machine Learning, and the resampling methods, such as Bootstrap and Cross-validation, while perfoming a Bias-variance decomposition analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to set up all our regression and resampling methods, we started working with a vanilla dataset given by the Franke function, depending of two independent variables $x$ and $y$, with an added stochastic noise. At the end, we performed the code with a real dataset taken from a terrain survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Franke's function** is a weighted sum of four exponentials:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "f(x,y) &= \\frac{3}{4}\\exp{\\left(-\\frac{(9x-2)^2}{4} - \\frac{(9y-2)^2}{4}\\right)}+\\frac{3}{4}\\exp{\\left(-\\frac{(9x+1)^2}{49}- \\frac{(9y+1)}{10}\\right)} \\\\\n",
    "&+\\frac{1}{2}\\exp{\\left(-\\frac{(9x-7)^2}{4} - \\frac{(9y-3)^2}{4}\\right)} -\\frac{1}{5}\\exp{\\left(-(9x-4)^2 - (9y-7)^2\\right) }.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The function is defined for $x,y\\in [0,1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<right><img src=\"img/FrankeFunction.png\" width=\"650\"></right>\n",
    "\n",
    "As concerning the noise, we generate datasets with different amounts of noise by changing the $\\sigma$ value of its normal distribution $\\epsilon \\sim \\cal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)$. By comparing the plot of the Franke function with and without noise and looking at further results, $\\sigma=[0.1,0.2]$ gives a reasonable amount of noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical background\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: the explanation is given assuming a two-dimensional problem, in order to emphathise the physical idea and not to overwhelm the explanation of indexes little useful for the understanding. Just consider inputs $x$ as both indipendent variables $(x,y)$ and the outputs $y$ as the third dimension $z$. Relevant differences will be pointed out through notes.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the two datasets of inputs $x=[x_0,x_1,...x_{n-1}]$ and the outputs $y=[y_0,y_1,...y_{n-1}]$, we perform a polynomial fit of this function using Regression methods with the following **basic assumption**. There exists a continuous function (some degree-order polynomial) $f(x)$ s.t. we can interpret the outputs as **$y(x)=f(x)+\\epsilon$**. Basically we are splitting the outputs into a deterministic component, our model, and a stochastic error contribution $\\epsilon$. Also, an importnant assumption is given by this error $\\epsilon$ that we assume normally distributed with $\\mu=0$ and variance $\\sigma^2$ ($\\epsilon \\sim \\cal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "So now assuming that the $f(x)$ can be approximated as a polynomial of $k$ degree, we get the following expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y=y(x) \\ \\ \\rightarrow \\\\ y(x_i)=\\tilde{y}_i+\\epsilon_i=\\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \\beta_j x_i^j+\\epsilon_i, \\\\ \\forall i=0,...n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So that our model $\\boldsymbol{\\tilde{y}}$ (i.e. without the stochastic component) can be rewritten in a matricial notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{\\tilde{y}}= \\boldsymbol{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $X$ is called *Design matrix* with $n$ rows and the number of columns depending on the degree of the polynomial. While $\\beta$ is the estimator vector of the coefficients of our regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: in the three-dimensional problem, each row of the design matrix would look like $X_{i*}=[x_i, y_i,\n",
    "x_i^2, y_i^2, x_iy_i, \\dots]$. If the polynomial is of degree $k$ than our model will have $k'=\\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}$ ($k>0$) feutures, that means $k'$ columns of the design matrix and elements in $\\beta$. The design matrix is then $(n \\ \\text{x} \\ k')$.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to find the optimal $\\hat{\\beta}$ that is the one that minimizes the cost function $C(X,\\beta)$ (i.e. the \"difference\" between our data and the model we are choosing). In our own case, the $MSE$ is taken as cost function:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C(X,\\beta)=MSE(X,\\beta)=\\\\ =\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\left(y_i-\\tilde{y}_i\\right)^2=\\\\ =\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\left(y_i-X_{i*}\\beta\\right)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression of the optimal $\\hat{\\beta}$ depends on the regression methods choosen. Here we explore the Linear (Ordinary Least Square, OLS), Ridge and Lasso Regression. For further details, see the introduction of the respective exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is structured into libraries (e.g. `regression.py`), which gather all the functions needed for solving the various tasks, while the specific task codes are in `task*.py` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the course of this notebook, we inserted runnable cells to run the task codes directly and dynamically from here to show up the results, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%run ./1project/task1.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After a brief introduction, we will explain the algorithm, show the results and comment on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: a further improvement to the code would be structuring as **object-oriented**. We have started converting the code but by the time of the deadline it was not ready to be runnable yet.*"

Then we create the design matrix $X$ for a polynomial of degree 5 and we split the data into a 80% training and 20% test datasets. This datasets are then rescaled subtracting the mean value and we perfom a Ordinary Least Square regression to have the model outputs ($z$ values from the training data) and the prediction ones ($z$ values from the test data). The matrix pseudoinverse provided by *numpy* is used to evaluate the inverse in the OLS equation, even when this is singular. The error analysis is then applied to both the training and test outputs and the confidence interval of the $\\beta$ estimetors is evaluated.\n",

    "- `Plot_frankefunction(x,y,z)`: create a 3d plot suitable for displaying the Franke function.\n",

    "- `Split_and_Scale(X,z,test_size=0.2, scale=True)`: split the dataset, using *train_test_split* from Scikit-Learn, into a training and test datasets in a fraction given by a *test_size* (default value *0.2*). Scaling the data is optional, according the problem. The default boolean argument is *scale=True* and it uses the *StandardScaler(with_std=False)* from Scikit-Learn to subtract the mean value from the dataset. \n",
    "- `OLS_solver(X_train, X_test, z_train, z_test)`: evaluate the OLS equation through matix inversion and return the optimal $\\hat{\\beta}$ values, our model $\\tilde{z}$ ($z$ values from the training data) and our prediction ($z$ values from the test data). \n",

    "First of all we are asked to analyse the MSE both for training and testing data as a function of complexity (i.e. degree of fitting polynomial), in order to identify the best complexity. The question is: *which is the best complexity then?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the following picture, taken from [Hastie et al.](https://github.com/CompPhysics/MLErasmus/blob/master/doc/Textbooks/elementsstat.pdf):\n",
    "\n",
    "<right><img src=\"img/MSE_complexity.png\" width=\"500\"></right>\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the testing MSE, we expect that it tends to 0, because we are tuning our model on the training dataset and the \"difference\" between the real data and our model tends to 0 when complexity increases. Considering instead the test MSE, it show a U-behaviour, getting to an increase when reaching a certain value of complexity. This means we are overfitting. Testing the model on new fresh data allows us to check if the model is \"over-complex\" and tends to pass through every single datapoint without considering and buffering the stochastic noise, as it should be. Here is a picture showing case of **underfitting and overfitting**:\n",

    "\n",
    "### <font color=purple>Bootstrap and resampling techniques</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Resampling techniques are used to have more robust outputs from the model analysis. This means that if we want to evaluate the MSE, doing it once may not be sufficient to investigate the real bahaviour of the model. The basic idea is **resampling and reshuffling the dataset, then performing the algorithm on this \"new\" dataset for $b$ times, having then a probability distribution of the estimator we want to investigate** (in our case this is the optimal $\\hat{\\beta}$). \n",
