üöß *This repository is WIP*

This repository aims to explore different tecniques of Machine Learning and Data Analysis, such as Linear and Logistic Regression, Neural Networks and Deep Learning methods, Decision Trees...

It is created for the course [*FYS-STK4155 - Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning*](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS-STK4155/index-eng.html) held by professor [Morten Hjorth-Jensen](https://github.com/mhjensen) (University of Oslo, AY2021-2022).

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª The main contributors to this repository are [Fridtjof Gjengset](https://github.com/fridtjrg), [Adele Zaini](https://github.com/adelezaini) and Gaute Holen.


## Description
[...]

Follow the [GitHub link](https://github.com/CompPhysics/MachineLearning) of the course for any further information.

## Projects
During the course we are asked to handle in three projects with tasks that allow us to practice on the different techniques.
All the material is located on the ```projects``` derectory, including the source codes and delivery reports (quick link here for the [```reports``` directory](https://github.com/fridtjrg/FYS-STK4155/tree/main/projects/reports)).
