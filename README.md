![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/adelezaini/MachineLearning)

🚧 *This repository is WIP*

This repository aims to explore different tecniques of Machine Learning and Data Analysis, such as Linear and Logistic Regression, Neural Networks and Deep Learning methods, Decision Trees...

It is created for the course [*FYS-STK4155 - Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning*](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS-STK4155/index-eng.html) held by professor [Morten Hjorth-Jensen](https://github.com/mhjensen) (University of Oslo, AY2021-2022).

👩🏻‍💻 The main contributors to this repository are [Fridtjof Gjengset](https://github.com/fridtjrg), [Adele Zaini](https://github.com/adelezaini) and [Gaute Holen](https://github.com/GauteHolen).


## Description
Different techniques of Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning are here explored. The work is divided into three projects:

- *Project1*: Regression and resampling techniques (OLS, Ridge, Lasso Reegression - Bootstrap and cross validation). Bias-variance analysis.

**⚠️ Deadline: 11 Oct 2021 (POSTPONED: 12 Oct 2021)**
- *Project2*:

Deadline: 13 Nov 2021

- *Project3*:

Deadline: 13 Dic 2021
